  $('#summarizeArticle').click(function() {


    var data3 = {
      "model": model,
      "prompt": "Here is a detailed journalistic summary of this article written by " + author + ":\n that credits " + author + " as the author: \n" + prompt,
      "max_tokens": max_tokens,
      "temperature": temperature
    };
  
    Check if this will work, I moved the functions inside the summerizetext function and added an if and else to run different functions depending on whether the text should be summarized or not
