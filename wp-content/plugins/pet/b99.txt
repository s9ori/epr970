This probably was discussed already but thoughts on lmr k group win?
Havent seen the episode in full yet but I am assuming k back door won the mcountdown stage since Mnet is really trying gaslight me into thinking its the best performance ever with this editing
Oh ok. The voting makes sense then. Things will probably change a bit in the 2nd mission
Im disappointed like how jay chang got only 66 of score he deserved better. You heard his vocals, very talented.
Krystian is not good at persuading people, but in the end the only Chinese guy to debut is Zhang Hao, it wont matter what Krystian does or doesnt do, he wont debut.
But at the end of the day, these are exactly the people who will determine beplers popularity
i already stayed up late and got bamboozled, only the voting closed and the elimination is in 5 hours. goodnight yall LMAO im gonna find out in the morning im not built for this
It really is weird how some trainees act like theyre not aware of what kind of show theyre in despite it being widely publicised
k back door thoughts:

 min seoungs rapping and flips are so good, but i feel like not enough people acknowledge him sigh ppl dont talk about the nunu nana team enough
 another underrated person is ji yun seo the main vocal i thought he did pretty well? i feel like he got overshadowed by the other k group yuehua trainees and ppl are still not acknowledging his vocals
 im glad han yujin did well in the actual performance 
 CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW JONGWOO SLAYED THAT CENTER POSITION? HE DESERVES MORE THAN JUST ONE STAR
 jiwoongs abs killed me
The fanbases will know from gp999 that the use of mass sim cards is acceptable...
Agreed.  Wakeone Mnet is shooting itself in the foot by not directly using the concrete popularity of certain members of GP999, and instead pushing those who had lower ranking again and again.  

The line distribution of izone seemed to shift around much more than it does in kep1er.  

Im waiting for the upcoming episode of a third of the participants gushing over a blessed members baby pictures, and then going to that members family restaurant all episode...
Am I the only one who thinks the Love Me Right  G Group team got robbed?!
I appreciate that Jiwoong was the leader, but DIDNT use that to place himself artificially in high distribution points.  Others with a greater need to get votes, got the opportunity to show themselves to the audience.  I think that group as a whole benefitted from it, and had a greater team spirit because of it.  

You can think that he didnt earn the votes and popularity he has, but I think it was smart leadership to be more collaborative and promote his team mates.  

Are the audience members not required to cast a vote? I wouldnt expect them to be required, but it feels strange to me that over 150 people would just not vote for anyone from either group in Aju Nice.

  Osuke
Thank you for explaining it well, g group fans are getting too annoying these days
The PDs love Zhang Hao and Matthew, theyre pretty set to debut if things go according to plan
  Mnet not highlighting the high notes in Burn It Up was a CHOICE, like come on both of the K and G main vocals did so well Mnet could have at least edited more hype into their parts üò≠

  That scene where the dance master got this sad music edit when the dude from Burn It Up made the same mistake on stage was really reminiscent of Sohyes Irony edit with Bae Yoonjung lol

  Not once in my life did I imagine Daeul getting an evil edit...tho I wouldnt really call it an evil edit, bro set himself up...must mean he is not much of an Mnet favorite than we thought

  Tbh I liked Danger G more and hoped they would win, but Seunghwan really deserved those votes, good for him!!

  When Park Hanbin got those 250+ votes I SCREAMED

  Most memorable trainee for me that I didnt know before was Yuto. Hope he survives this round

  Love Me Right K was a concert indeed! Everyone did so well!!
Honestly the amount of comments asking Daeul to go home was sickening, at one point I had enough and quickly made a comment asking people to stop but of course it probably didn‚Äôt get noticed because new comments come in all the time.
As an official mod statement: Once the first elimination livestream airs ~17 hours from now, any discussion/spoilers of the first elimination are banned on this Post Episode thread. We will have an official discussion thread for the livestream that will be spoiler tagged, and you can discuss the results in other spoiler tagged posts as well. However, we will be very strict about disallowing reactions to the first elimination results on this thread ex. saying stuff like I loved Xs performance, so sad he got eliminated : can get you temporarily banned.
They should have brought back planet pass hmph
just the live announcement, probably most of the ranking leaving the top 2 and 52nd last to survived place to be edited and show proper announcement next week with some filler sport day thing y.
A few random thoughts:

  it was absolutely brutal watching g group get slammed. Many of them did so good, the large gap in points would have been so demoralising 
  all the leaders did really well! Even when odds were stacked against them.  Park Hanbin especially, such a natural at getting a balance between discipline, support, and encouragement
  I have such a crush on Lip J
  Sung Hanbin cannot be real. How can anyone be this perfect.

Also, something shady as hell was going on with Mnets vocal processing, cos how does Huis vocals sound richer and more resonant in a [cellphone recording from an audience member ]https://twitter.com/O714ZZANG/status/1628007969744121857?t=L5V4gooTXaQHKbXCGss9wQ&amp;s=19 than Mnets own videos.
Expanding my thought from the livethread about how this whole show is an exercise in nationalism: the G group serves two narratives from Mnet. 1 To show Kpop‚Äôs global reach and having trainees from countries all over   even ones that have historically colonized or threatened South Korea. This demonstrates a venue in which Korea is ‚Äôwinning‚Äô over these global powers. 2 But nonetheless, to show that the Korean trainees are superior to the foreign ones. This is inherently a given of course, but with the trainees they selected, again, it shows Korea winning over these other countries. A couple G trainees might make it through to showcase point 1, though   hard to keep getting foreign trainees if none of them ever debut.

The results of the show, with K dominating and the G trainees getting decimated, means the show is working as intended. It‚Äôs annoying and boring and I feel bad as hell for some of the G trainees, but it‚Äôs also not a surprise. My slightly more controversial opinion is considering Korean history with being subjugated and under threat by Japan and China so much, I sort of understand why this is the case.
Anyone joining the vote only G Group alliance?
It feels like theyre mostly there to humble a few contestants and to give instructions as to how mnet wants us to react to certain performances lol
I really wish Hui didn‚Äôt sign up to do this show because now a singer with over a decade of experience is being compared and pitted against another trainee‚Ä¶. I genuinely don‚Äôt even care if he doesn‚Äôt make it to the final line up, but I can never get behind the ‚ÄúJay was better‚Äù argument. It all comes down to opinion in the end and I think Hui was brilliant and his experience showed   that being said, he did feel the need to go above and beyond after seeing how well Jay did, and that‚Äôs a compliment to Jay in itself
noooooooooooo not the parents house üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
the audience was made up of 50% foreigners btw if anyone noticed :
I think it‚Äôs gonna stop after the first elimination coz im sure most of the g group would be wiped out after thisüíÄ
after this ep, these boys are now on my radar:

jongwoo  
park hanbin  
kim taerae  
park jihoo  
seunghwan
Feel bad for danger group when they overall had the better performance and even though 66 votes aint little Jay deserved more, heck they all did..
Aight Ill be voting for all g group trainees later.
any filos here who can help where to watch boys planet without having to wait a day or 2 for subs. Even without subs is okay with me üòÖüòÖ
I KNOW! And they didn‚Äôt even explain it! He would have stood much more of a chance if he got main rapper. Jianyu did well tho
Can‚Äôt wait for the episode we go to yujin‚Äôs parents house üò≠üò≠
I‚Äôm not even a fan of Krystian, I just found it shocking that that was used as a negative criticism towards him. The teacher could have said ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù, but instead he said ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù. Also, maybe the teacher said in Korean that he danced femininely, but the subtitles said feminine if I remember correctly. Oje can be critical of Krystian‚Äôs dancing in this instance without utilising sexist language.
koreans are racists aff, they vote only for koreans
yeah they are literally just like a guide? but not a guide at the same time if that makes sense
He will probably survive this round but Mnet has been super aggressive with the harsh edit compared to GP with the trainees they dont want to actually made it
1. They dragged the Love Me Right k Group performance so damn much that I wasnt even able to enjoy it as much as I should have. Thank God G group performed last week and I was able to enjoy it fully. 

2. MNET is trying super hard to give messy edits to Lee Daeul and Krystian lol. Its very clear. 

3. Backdoor K group was fire and they won against the G group pretty easily. Jongwoo was the MVP of that team and he was so ducking good. Please vote for him.

4. People can hate on Jiwoong as much as they want but he commands the stage. His presence is unreal and his visuals are something else. So leave the hate train and join the appreciation train please. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

5. Why was this episode so short. They could have given us some fun backstage moments for half an hour. Some good interactions between K and G group members. I wish they release more of those BTS videos. üò≠
&gt; of it paid off. and

FTFY.

Although payed exists the reason why autocorrection didnt help you, it is only correct in:

  Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion resistant. The deck is yet to be payed.

  Payed out when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. The rope is payed out! You can pull now.

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope related words in your comment.

Beep, boop, Im a bot
yes, theres going to be a livestream for the 1st elimination at 2/24 3PM KST and well have another live discussion thread for that in this sub
the way they pretty much only highlighted the problems in the g groups as if the other k groups did not have their own struggles during the training. mnet just getting rid of as many g trainees as possible smh
As someone who came back from pdx101, we used to have cut aways from performances for reaction shots. And I get it, it builds hype and acknowledges talent.

But now we have wholeass story arcs in the middle of a performance like what?? Its so distracting and takesaway from the performance.

Pls mnet dont do this in the position battles IM BEGGING üò´
The full tactical takedown, character assassination, libel and slander campaigns against dauel and krystian were brutal both were dragged and read to filth oml
i‚Äôm honestly so pissed at the voting differences like i do think k group did better overall but g group did not deserve to get decimated by that margin. Especially Jay he was almost equal to Hui imo. And Kamden and Ollie getting decimated by ab showings they need to cut it out it gets old after the first one üò≠ G group looked so dejected and i would be too if i just got flattened like that. They worked so hard and had to overcome so many barriers in each group and none of it payed off. and now they‚Äôre all in danger of elimination whether they deserve it or not. This honestly took the joy out of the episode for me since so many of my faves are in g group. Even the KTL group who is safe seemed so sad because their friends couldn‚Äôt make it. I can‚Äôt stand this bruh
I feel like they should up the age for the minimum age you have to be to be on the show because you can tell the younger ones are having a tough time mentally : What are your thoughts?
vote g group, they‚Äôre getting decimated
Yeah certainly! Overall it was weird how the judges were basically nonexistent in exerting their power over who they believe to be better. No bonus points based off of mentor assessment, no planet pass,...
Ikrr its so hard to watch this kind of rivalry üò¢. I want some k and g wholesome interactions!!
Voting for Haruto and Jay today.


Sorry Zhantthew you both are going to be safe and we dont want talents to be eliminated tomorrow
Guys if you think this editing is crazy just wait for the next few episodes. After first elim, Krystian and Daeul will be going through it. Clearly Mnet doesn‚Äôt want either of them and after bahiyyih they will do everything in their power to prevent someone they don‚Äôt want entering the top9. All the trainees they actually want are going to be heavily pushed. Shanbin, Matthew, Zhanghaon and other top trainees won‚Äôt get a single bad edit. Seunghwan, Yongsoo, Phanbin will be HEAVILY pushed closer to the higher rankings.
&gt; of it paid off. and

alright fellow G group stans, are we all ready to personally fistfight Mnet or do some of you need to warm up first?
I honestly prefer Jays.. I mean imagine how Jay would be with 7 years of experience under his belt.
i‚Äôm honestly so pissed at the voting differences like i do think k group did better overall but g group did not deserve to get decimated by that margin.

I can‚Äôt stand this bruh
honestly Daeul‚Äôs edit really shocked me because I thought Mnet was wanting to push him as the representative ‚Äòdozen‚Äô ie Kim Minkyu
So there is livestream again tomorrow?
Tbh I may have just preferred the GP version of the mentors voting for the battle winner tbh, or at least maybe them having a vote. Like 50% mentors 50% audience ?
I am crushed for ggroup. so many talented trainees are going to be eliminated tomorrow for the sin /s of not being in kgroup
Could not get through the scenes with Krystian, mnet is so nasty man.

Happy for Park Hanbin, finally he got some screentime and he was a good leader too! Hopefully hell rank higher next week. 

Also happy for Kim Taerae to go on m countdown i also really liked the k back door group, they felt very cohesive to me but i beg you mnet, please give him more than 5 second screen time....
Indeed, didnt want to write it that way, because many people here make a segregation between korean korean and korean any other nationality.
K group deserved all the wins they got. Only kill this love g group was better than k group. G group love me right performance was fun to watch but it felt like watching high school students perform like in high school musical or glee but k group love me right felt like watching idols having their concert, they was a balance between fun and professionalism. 
K group Hot sauce performance was very good, why were people saying it was bad and they beat g group by farrr. 
K group back door was the best, they were in sync, everyone of them was shining it didn‚Äôt lack vocal, dance or rap. G group back door only Ricky really got to shine and Brian too was good, the rest were meh.
I don‚Äôt know if Mnet is trying to sabotage krystain but krystain is quite opinionated and it‚Äôs not a bad thing, he should have volunteered to be leader.
Hui adlibs were really good 
In the live stream, a lot of people were really insulting hui calling him old flop and da eul too saying he should be eliminated, please you people should choose you words wisely.
so i guess mnet dont want daeul, i fully expected him to get the he isnt a dozen after all edit bc he pulled out a decent rap. im not a fan of him but i thought itd be nice. but instead we got this edit where it looked like he was evil mastermind who picked contestants who were subservient to him so he could get a good part bc he knows hes wouldnt get one in any other team. and in exchange he would make them win through his popularity which he thinks hell maintain no matter his performance. the only actual evidence of that is the one comment he made so im not taking it at face value. but i am surprised that daeul has a little fight in him  and would do anything to keep his part like this behind his cute image this boy is competitive
Abs stay undefeated
Sorry Im a little bit over Jiwoong do basically nothing and still get all the points.  Both of this performance were sloppy still people act like he was the best. 
Jiwoong should show that he worthy to debut because of his skills not because he is a bl actor and has visual. Because right now he doesnt show anything. no sing, no rapping either 
Maybe if he debut he get the hiyyih treatment
depends what you consider the next episode. normally the first eliminations are episode 5 but mnet is being weird so tomorrow is technically the live first elimination which isn‚Äôt episode 5, bc the actual episode be next week. so short answer, technically no but yes i would consider it an episode since it‚Äôs a pretty huge moment in the show.
Jiwoong himbofication supremacyüòå
I really dont understand the 180 degree change in narrative. Isnt the entire goal to create a GLOBAL GROUP, not see how much k group is better than g group. In Girls Planet they were basically forced and paired with people of other nationalities, and eliminations at the start happened by portion of each group. I dont understand why they kept making the groups compete with each other in BP.
yeah or they shouldve made vote for an even number of k and g contestants
Also to add the point of there being a pre existing fanbase
I find it weird that being one of the most popular trainees and the trainee that got most votes overall, jiwoong has zero screentime and no storyline at all in this ep‚Ä¶ like i at least expected some interactions between members of his group instead of the focus to be on yujin again
Kamden kinda has an Eminem look to him, Im a casual and I didnt even know he rapped
Jiwoong himbofication supremacyüòå
Right, if its not for daeul and krystian it will be a boring eps
It‚Äôs so fucked how ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù is still an insult in 2023. Literally all the trainer had to say was ‚Äúlacking charisma‚Äù, ‚Äúneeds more powerful movements‚Äù, etc. Hell, even saying Krystian ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt make a memorable center‚Äù would be a better criticism than ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù. 

Hopefully it makes a difference.
I WAS SHOCKED
I think it‚Äôs 100k for teams that win and then 10k for the group that one
Ngl I cannot stand the kamdem and krystian storyline. Honest I think its kamdems fault because why are you a leader and not communicating with your group about talking over you. The lack of him communicating his hurt feelings is so frustrating.
Im soooo nervous about the live ranking announcement tmr‚Ä¶ will there be a live discussion thread as well? I NEED IT SO BAD
For real. I was tearing up by the end of the episode. It hurts me so much to see G Group losing against K Group literally every single time. Idk what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes at MNET but this isn‚Äôt normal imo.
he didnt mean it in a bad way I think he just meant that his image didnt suit the song nothing wrong with im being feminine
Well, at least Kim Tae Rae, Kum Jun Hyeon, Kim Min Seoung and Yoon Jong Woo will get a chance to shine in mccoundown and the dance studio
Lowkey felt like torture porn of G group suffering like wtf is going on Mnet
fr like it reeks of homophobia and krystian didn‚Äôt even look that feminine? they could have just told him he looked weak as a center and it would have been fine
Votes reopen in less than hour! Don‚Äôt forget to vote today!
Well one thing I can say is that I‚Äôve seen a lifetime worth of abs in this one episode üòÇüòÇ
&gt;After BackDoor performance Im finally starting to get the Jiwoong appeal. He might not be the best dancer, but he does have some charisma, and I feel like he was much with this song than with Mirotic. 

&gt;With that said, Yoon Jongwoo is genuinely amazing and I cant believe that he might leave the competition so soon. If he is able to survive this he will definitely be my main pick next rounds. 

&gt;Park Hanbin is also amazing and I feel like he has a chance of becoming a Dark Horse, so Im crossing my fingers. He is genuinely great and watching his fancam is  really fun. 

[Copying my comment from the weekly thread to here, since it fits this more lol]
What are they gonna do if nearly all of g group gets wiped out???
I have a question, will the elimination have an even number of people from each group survive or just 52 overall? sorry if this has been asked before
So its okay to call this an evil edit, but the whole live chat was acting like Daeul was satan for portraying the fact that he perhaps wanted his part that he signed up for?

Like Im sorry, its not like Mnet put words in Krystians mouth. He genuinely did something that was a tad fucked. If he didnt, why would the whole team have to round up and have a chat to each other about the problem?

People acting like everything is evil editing is SO stupid.
I‚Äôm a little bit confused I thought the benefit was 100k not 10k?
THAT WAS SO FUCKED
This is whole episode was about g group going through the slaughterhouse which was absolutely disgusting of MNET to do.
The evil editing really came out with full force this week like dang they took down daeul and Krystian
Honestly im starting to just vote the evil edits materials, like Daeul, Yugeng, Hui, Gunwook, Krystian, theyre the ones keeping the show going
Kamden is just going through it EVERY SINGLE EPISODE üò≠ His team was so hard to work with, he got no lines, and then he got absolutely DECIMATED by Jiwoongs abs even tho he should have gotten the main rapper part and showed his skills. And he still came out humble and grateful after all that??? Kamden better than me fr üò≠ I need him to survive so he can FINALLY rap on air cuz he hasn‚Äôt rapped ONCE on live tv cuz i‚Äôm so sick of him getting REPEATEDLY snubbed üò≠ He hasn‚Äôt even shown his funny personality on the show yet like he did on wild idol, he‚Äôs just a perpetual victim
              

Post Episode Thoughts:

 Its funny to see how effective the A vs B narratives are so effective from Mnet, this is probably the most successful strategy Mnet has employed in terms of setting a narrative that sets the discourse while not being apparent to most people, even the people who seem more cognizant of the edits Mnet puts forward. When I see Sub Vocal A got 16 votes while Sub Vocal B got 10 votes and I see everyone cheering for Sub Vocal A winning, I just have to laugh, the audience voters arent voting based on who did best in which role, theyre just voting for their #1 pick across both teams, and its not much of a win if you only get 16 votes while everyone else in every other position gets more votes than you. Seeing so many people sad for Ollie even though he got 60 votes way more than most contestants did just because he was framed/pitted against Jiwoong really shows the effectiveness of this binary versus format and how it drives discourse. And of course, the whole Hui vs Jay binary framing that drives so much of the discourse even on the subreddit, not to mention countless other examples. This isnt anything new and has been done in Produce seasons, but I think Im realizing the true scale of its effectiveness for the first time. Like, I personally wished we got to see 14 songs performed in this round instead of just 7 songs, but its clear that having only 7 songs for A vs B battles was a smart choice by Mnet, comparisons drive all the discourse.

 While Episode 4 isnt going to really change the results of the upcoming eliminations, I think theres going to be a lot of risers in the ranks from this episode, which should be fun: we got Lee Seunghwan, Yoon Jongwoo, Na Kamden, and Park Hanbin as the main risers from this episode, with Ricky, Ollie, and Park Jihoo all likely rising some spots as well. I think many of the top ranks are still fairly locked in, but we at least can see some movement with the finale contenders.

 On the flip side, itll be interesting to see how the narratives and editing set by Mnet this episode changes the overall Reddit opinion on individual performers and performances. Since we have an archive of peoples thoughts on the EP4 fancams before this episode, well be able to compare and see how effective aired compliments and judge praise are at changing the narrative on a performance.
nope, live eliminations will be tomorrow they prob don‚Äôt wanna ruin the suspense.
I found it so disrespectful when the dance teacher told him he‚Äôs too feminine like wtf
Live Episode Notes:

 That was a pretty decent rap by Kei during the practice evaluation.

 It feels like theyre spending a surprisingly long amount of screentime on Burn It Up G roup, when pretty much none of them are going to make it past the first elimination. Big focus on Chen Renyou and Xuan Hao here.

 Burn It Up G Group: Its interesting if Kei is gonna get what I call the Nonaka Shana effect ie. if being praised in the edit will significantly boost peoples opinions of that performer, although Kei likely wont survive the first elimination and so it likely wont matter. Chen Renyou and Yutaka did a good job with the vocals, Hyos and Keis raps were decent as well. 

 The 2 youngest K Group contestants Seyun and Seunghun crying a lot..... this definitely supports the side of Redditors who say Some contestants are too young. Park Minseok is gonna get a lot of sympathy but hell likely be eliminated in first eliminations anyways.

 This is somewhat a divergence of topic, but I HATE how contestants arent allowed to choose their own songs for the group mission and your fate instead comes to whether a basically random team leader will choose you for their team, and then how high your team is in the precedence/priority team. It makes teams really unbalanced and feels very unfair, and I get that thats the point, but I still would like to vent out my frustrations with the format anyways.

 Burn It Up K Group: Vocals Gwanyoung, Minseok, and Hojin were pretty solid, Hoyoung did a great job with the rap. Im not sure if this is an unpopular opinion, but I dont like Seyuns rapping, he sounds like he has a lack of energy when delivering his rap. Gwanyoung was the MVP for me, a shame that they didnt highlight him more in the edit, I guess it doesnt matter though because hes almost certainly going to be eliminated in the first eliminations.

 Another conflict edit centered on Chinese contestants..... some things are constant for Mnet, lol.

 Danger G Group: Dong Dongs rap was solid. I dont think Ive ever seen so much praise in the edit for that amount of cracks, but honestly, props to Yang Jun. Yuto did the best with his rap, but his inherent color/tone doesnt gel with this song, and Takutos color/tone matches even less. Yugeng did a decent job with the vocals.

 Wow, a bad edit for Lee Daeul, I honestly didnt expect that, especially since I thought he was on track to making the final lineup.

 Im usually not a fan of the judges, but ngl Lee Seokhoon I think thats how you romanize his name has been serving good advice according to the comments we see from him.

 Danger K Group: Is it just me, or are these long will they be able to improve from practice evaluations intermissions much more frequent this season? Kim Minhyuk and Lee Seunghwan were the standouts to me, Choi Jiho also did very well. I didnt like Daeuls rap, but I dont think thats an unpopular opinion, at least with Reddit. EDIT: The Kim Minhyuk erasure that Mnet did is not it, Im not seeing enough Minhyuk appreciation in the Reddit comments frfr

 Ive been wanting to say this for a while, but the line distribution for Back Door is fucking AWFUL, theres barely any lines to share around, I feel like at least 3 members of each team get no actual vocal/rap lines, and thats frustrating.

 Damn, Han Yujin got basically all of the Back Door edit screentime whilst pretty much every other team had multiple protagonists, and thats in spite of Back Door having a bunch of popular contestants and Mnet favorites. They really are pushing him hard.

 Back Door K Group: Ji Yunseo did a great job with the vocals, Kim Minseoung and Kim Taerae did a decent job with the rap and vocals. Yoon Jongwoo had amazing facial expressions, definitely the standout of the team in the facial expressions department. Again though, theres very few vocal/rap lines since they cut Verse 2 of Back Door and a lot of members dont get actual vocal/rap lines, so it makes the members tough to assess.

 The wildness of Krystian you look too feminine.... first for me, I didnt agree with that judges assessment based on what we saw, Krystian was trying to be fierce in the little snippets we saw of him as Center. Also, theres some idea inside that comment that has merit, but the way it was worded was yikes, just say You need fiercer and more powerful facial expressions, hell, even saying You need to give off more manly energy would be a better worded statement.

 The Krystian evil edit in full swing.... well, a lot of Redditors did correctly predict this would happen pre season, so props to them its a little sad how predictable Mnet can be.

 Back Door G Group: Chen Jianyu had a pretty solid rap, Feng Junlan did a decent job with the vocals as well. Again, I dont really have much to say since theres barely any actual vocal/rap lines in the song for the members to deliver. Facial expressions wise based on the focus cams, no one really stood out from this team in my personal opinion Chen Jianyu did the best of them imo.

 Hot Sauce G Group: Since the audience comments panned this performance, Id bet a good amount of money that Mnet autotuned the vocals and stuff to make the performance look better than it was because in prior seasons, they usually do that for performances that were panned by the audience. Oh well, what we saw and heard was pretty decent anyways I feel like it maybe was fine tuned here on the episode compared to the focus cams, but dont quote me on that lol. Ill rewatch the focus cams again to see if there was any tuning on the episode.

 Itll be interesting to see whether a strict leader in a positive edit Park Hanbin or a strict leader in a dramatic edit ex. Na Kamden, Park Minseok, Chen Yugeng gets a bigger increase in popularity. I suppose the question is partially nullified because Minseok and Yugeng are likely being eliminated in the first eliminations, so itll be Phanbin vs Kamden, and then the circumstances of Kamdens narrative ex. being the only non Chinese member leading an all Chinese team will make the comparison too dissimilar to have any real takeaways.

 Hot Sauce K Group: Pretty solid performance overall. The 3 Parks Park Jihoo, Park Hhyunbeen, and Park Hanbin all did really well. Genuinely curious why Park Hanbin did not take the Main Vocalist role hes a better vocalist than Lee Donggun or seemingly try for Center, but given how much he was hyped even before the performance began, I guess it was a win for him because he gets all the Center boost effect without being Center and can go for Center for the rest of the rounds without problem.

 Ollie still got 60 votes even though the audience comments were the most negative on him? Likewise I find it funny that the comments in this section are saying Ollies votes were so low, 60 votes is way more than most contestants get during this mission, especially compared to the rest of G Group and compared to his popularity. Maybe this really was a case of The select few of the audience we heard from gave unrepresentative opinions.

 This is the second episode in a row theyve pointed out Sung Hanbin not going for Center lol, really pushing out all the efforts here with the golden edit.

 Love Me Right K Group: They surprisingly didnt highlight Sung Hanbin as much during the performance as I thought they would, I guess Mnet know already that most of the eyes are already on him. Its kinda funny to see Mnet resume the Hui vs Jay narrative after a large break in the episode from it I just find it funny how all the discussion has been reduced down to comparing these two specifically instead of against the whole field of performances. Hui and Han Seobin were the MVPs for me, Lee Yedam was very good as well.
was there no rankings at the end?
Mnet smiting Krystian with vengeance for having the gall to have a preshow fan base and rank in the 20s is wild. I was not expecting an evil edit on nearly Cai Bing level this early in the show, this shouldnt be scary for just Krystian fans, but a lot of contestants. If theyre already going this hard, just imagine how brutal theyre going to be later in the season when the stakes get higher. 

Mnet has learned their lesson with Bahiyyih, they are not playing any games with contestants they dont want in the lineup. They learned how quickly a contestants fan base can snowball with Cai Bing and I really dont think this is the last time well see an edit like that this season.
