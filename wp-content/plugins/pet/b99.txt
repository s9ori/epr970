alright fellow G group stans, are we all ready to personally fistfight Mnet or do some of you need to warm up first?
I honestly prefer Jays.. I mean imagine how Jay would be with 7 years of experience under his belt.
i‚Äôm honestly so pissed at the voting differences like i do think k group did better overall but g group did not deserve to get decimated by that margin. Especially Jay he was almost equal to Hui imo. And Kamden and Ollie getting decimated by ab showings they need to cut it out it gets old after the first one üò≠ G group looked so dejected and i would be too if i just got flattened like that. They worked so hard and had to overcome so many barriers in each group and none of it payed off. and now they‚Äôre all in danger of elimination whether they deserve it or not. This honestly took the joy out of the episode for me since so many of my faves are in g group. Even the KTL group who is safe seemed so sad because their friends couldn‚Äôt make it. I can‚Äôt stand this bruh
honestly Daeul‚Äôs edit really shocked me because I thought Mnet was wanting to push him as the representative ‚Äòdozen‚Äô ie Kim Minkyu
So there is livestream again tomorrow?
Tbh I may have just preferred the GP version of the mentors voting for the battle winner tbh, or at least maybe them having a vote. Like 50% mentors 50% audience ?
I am crushed for ggroup. so many talented trainees are going to be eliminated tomorrow for the sin /s of not being in kgroup
Could not get through the scenes with Krystian, mnet is so nasty man.

Happy for Park Hanbin, finally he got some screentime and he was a good leader too! Hopefully hell rank higher next week. 

In the live stream, a lot of people were really insulting hui calling him old flop and da eul too saying he should be eliminated, please you people should choose you words wisely.
so i guess mnet dont want daeul, i fully expected him to get the he isnt a dozen after all edit bc he pulled out a decent rap. im not a fan of him but i thought itd be nice. but instead we got this edit where it looked like he was evil mastermind who picked contestants who were subservient to him so he could get a good part bc he knows hes wouldnt get one in any other team. and in exchange he would make them win through his popularity which he thinks hell maintain no matter his performance. the only actual evidence of that is the one comment he made so im not taking it at face value. but i am surprised that daeul has a little fight in him  and would do anything to keep his part like this behind his cute image this boy is competitive
Abs stay undefeated
Sorry Im a little bit over Jiwoong do basically nothing and still get all the points.  Both of this performance were sloppy still people act like he was the best. 
Jiwoong should show that he worthy to debut because of his skills not because he is a bl actor and has visual. Because right now he doesnt show anything. no sing, no rapping either 
Maybe if he debut he get the hiyyih treatment
depends what you consider the next episode. normally the first eliminations are episode 5 but mnet is being weird so tomorrow is technically the live first elimination which isn‚Äôt episode 5, bc the actual episode be next week. so short answer, technically no but yes i would consider it an episode since it‚Äôs a pretty huge moment in the show.
Jiwoong himbofication supremacyüòå
I really dont understand the 180 degree change in narrative. Isnt the entire goal to create a GLOBAL GROUP, not see how much k group is better than g group. In Girls Planet they were basically forced and paired with people of other nationalities, and eliminations at the start happened by portion of each group. I dont understand why they kept making the groups compete with each other in BP.
yeah or they shouldve made vote for an even number of k and g contestants
Also to add the point of there being a pre existing fanbase
I find it weird that being one of the most popular trainees and the trainee that got most votes overall, jiwoong has zero screentime and no storyline at all in this ep‚Ä¶ like i at least expected some interactions between members of his group instead of the focus to be on yujin again
Kamden kinda has an Eminem look to him, Im a casual and I didnt even know he rapped
Jiwoong himbofication supremacyüòå
Right, if its not for daeul and krystian it will be a boring eps
It‚Äôs so fucked how ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù is still an insult in 2023. Literally all the trainer had to say was ‚Äúlacking charisma‚Äù, ‚Äúneeds more powerful movements‚Äù, etc. Hell, even saying Krystian ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt make a memorable center‚Äù would be a better criticism than ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù. 

Hopefully it makes a difference.
I WAS SHOCKED
I think it‚Äôs 100k for teams that win and then 10k for the group that one
Ngl I cannot stand the kamdem and krystian storyline. Honest I think its kamdems fault because why are you a leader and not communicating with your group about talking over you. The lack of him communicating his hurt feelings is so frustrating.
Im soooo nervous about the live ranking announcement tmr‚Ä¶ will there be a live discussion thread as well? I NEED IT SO BAD
For real. I was tearing up by the end of the episode. It hurts me so much to see G Group losing against K Group literally every single time. Idk what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes at MNET but this isn‚Äôt normal imo.
he didnt mean it in a bad way I think he just meant that his image didnt suit the song nothing wrong with im being feminine
Well, at least Kim Tae Rae, Kum Jun Hyeon, Kim Min Seoung and Yoon Jong Woo will get a chance to shine in mccoundown and the dance studio
Lowkey felt like torture porn of G group suffering like wtf is going on Mnet
fr like it reeks of homophobia and krystian didn‚Äôt even look that feminine? they could have just told him he looked weak as a center and it would have been fine
Votes reopen in less than hour! Don‚Äôt forget to vote today!
Well one thing I can say is that I‚Äôve seen a lifetime worth of abs in this one episode üòÇüòÇ
&gt;After BackDoor performance Im finally starting to get the Jiwoong appeal. He might not be the best dancer, but he does have some charisma, and I feel like he was much with this song than with Mirotic. 

What are they gonna do if nearly all of g group gets wiped out???
I have a question, will the elimination have an even number of people from each group survive or just 52 overall? sorry if this has been asked before
So its okay to call this an evil edit, but the whole live chat was acting like Daeul was satan for portraying the fact that he perhaps wanted his part that he signed up for?

Like Im sorry, its not like Mnet put words in Krystians mouth. He genuinely did something that was a tad fucked. If he didnt, why would the whole team have to round up and have a chat to each other about the problem?

People acting like everything is evil editing is SO stupid.
I‚Äôm a little bit confused I thought the benefit was 100k not 10k?
THAT WAS SO FUCKED
This is whole episode was about g group going through the slaughterhouse which was absolutely disgusting of MNET to do.
The evil editing really came out with full force this week like dang they took down daeul and Krystian
Honestly im starting to just vote the evil edits materials, like Daeul, Yugeng, Hui, Gunwook, Krystian, theyre the ones keeping the show going
Kamden is just going through it EVERY SINGLE EPISODE üò≠ His team was so hard to work with, he got no lines, and then he got absolutely DECIMATED by Jiwoongs abs even tho he should have gotten the main rapper part and showed his skills. And he still came out humble and grateful after all that??? Kamden better than me fr üò≠ I need him to survive so he can FINALLY rap on air cuz he hasn‚Äôt rapped ONCE on live tv cuz i‚Äôm so sick of him getting REPEATEDLY snubbed üò≠ He hasn‚Äôt even shown his funny personality on the show yet like he did on wild idol, he‚Äôs just a perpetual victim

Post Episode Thoughts:

 Its funny to see how effective the A vs B narratives are so effective from Mnet, this is probably the most successful strategy Mnet has employed in terms of setting a narrative that sets the discourse while not being apparent to most people, even the people who seem more cognizant of the edits Mnet puts forward. When I see Sub Vocal A got 16 votes while Sub Vocal B got 10 votes and I see everyone cheering for Sub Vocal A winning, I just have to laugh, the audience voters arent voting based on who did best in which role, theyre just voting for their #1 pick across both teams, and its not much of a win if you only get 16 votes while everyone else in every other position gets more votes than you. Seeing so many people sad for Ollie even though he got 60 votes way more than most contestants did just because he was framed/pitted against Jiwoong really shows the effectiveness of this binary versus format and how it drives discourse. And of course, the whole Hui vs Jay binary framing that drives so much of the discourse even on the subreddit, not to mention countless other examples. This isnt anything new and has been done in Produce seasons, but I think Im realizing the true scale of its effectiveness for the first time. Like, I personally wished we got to see 14 songs performed in this round instead of just 7 songs, but its clear that having only 7 songs for A vs B battles was a smart choice by Mnet, comparisons drive all the discourse.

 While Episode 4 isnt going to really change the results of the upcoming eliminations, I think theres going to be a lot of risers in the ranks from this episode, which should be fun: we got Lee Seunghwan, Yoon Jongwoo, Na Kamden, and Park Hanbin as the main risers from this episode, with Ricky, Ollie, and Park Jihoo all likely rising some spots as well. I think many of the top ranks are still fairly locked in, but we at least can see some movement with the finale contenders.

 On the flip side, itll be interesting to see how the narratives and editing set by Mnet this episode changes the overall Reddit opinion on individual performers and performances. Since we have an archive of peoples thoughts on the EP4 fancams before this episode, well be able to compare and see how effective aired compliments and judge praise are at changing the narrative on a performance.
nope, live eliminations will be tomorrow they prob don‚Äôt wanna ruin the suspense.
I found it so disrespectful when the dance teacher told him he‚Äôs too feminine like wtf
Live Episode Notes:

 That was a pretty decent rap by Kei during the practice evaluation.

 It feels like theyre spending a surprisingly long amount of screentime on Burn It Up G roup, when pretty much none of them are going to make it past the first elimination. Big focus on Chen Renyou and Xuan Hao here.

 Burn It Up G Group: Its interesting if Kei is gonna get what I call the Nonaka Shana effect ie. if being praised in the edit will significantly boost peoples opinions of that performer, although Kei likely wont survive the first elimination and so it likely wont matter. Chen Renyou and Yutaka did a good job with the vocals, Hyos and Keis raps were decent as well. 

 The 2 youngest K Group contestants Seyun and Seunghun crying a lot..... this definitely supports the side of Redditors who say Some contestants are too young. Park Minseok is gonna get a lot of sympathy but hell likely be eliminated in first eliminations anyways.

 This is somewhat a divergence of topic, but I HATE how contestants arent allowed to choose their own songs for the group mission and your fate instead comes to whether a basically random team leader will choose you for their team, and then how high your team is in the precedence/priority team. It makes teams really unbalanced and feels very unfair, and I get that thats the point, but I still would like to vent out my frustrations with the format anyways.

 Burn It Up K Group: Vocals Gwanyoung, Minseok, and Hojin were pretty solid, Hoyoung did a great job with the rap. Im not sure if this is an unpopular opinion, but I dont like Seyuns rapping, he sounds like he has a lack of energy when delivering his rap. Gwanyoung was the MVP for me, a shame that they didnt highlight him more in the edit, I guess it doesnt matter though because hes almost certainly going to be eliminated in the first eliminations.

 Another conflict edit centered on Chinese contestants..... some things are constant for Mnet, lol.

 Danger G Group: Dong Dongs rap was solid. I dont think Ive ever seen so much praise in the edit for that amount of cracks, but honestly, props to Yang Jun. Yuto did the best with his rap, but his inherent color/tone doesnt gel with this song, and Takutos color/tone matches even less. Yugeng did a decent job with the vocals.

 Wow, a bad edit for Lee Daeul, I honestly didnt expect that, especially since I thought he was on track to making the final lineup.

 Im usually not a fan of the judges, but ngl Lee Seokhoon I think thats how you romanize his name has been serving good advice according to the comments we see from him.

 Danger K Group: Is it just me, or are these long will they be able to improve from practice evaluations intermissions much more frequent this season? Kim Minhyuk and Lee Seunghwan were the standouts to me, Choi Jiho also did very well. I didnt like Daeuls rap, but I dont think thats an unpopular opinion, at least with Reddit. EDIT: The Kim Minhyuk erasure that Mnet did is not it, Im not seeing enough Minhyuk appreciation in the Reddit comments frfr

 Ive been wanting to say this for a while, but the line distribution for Back Door is fucking AWFUL, theres barely any lines to share around, I feel like at least 3 members of each team get no actual vocal/rap lines, and thats frustrating.

 Damn, Han Yujin got basically all of the Back Door edit screentime whilst pretty much every other team had multiple protagonists, and thats in spite of Back Door having a bunch of popular contestants and Mnet favorites. They really are pushing him hard.

 Back Door K Group: Ji Yunseo did a great job with the vocals, Kim Minseoung and Kim Taerae did a decent job with the rap and vocals. Yoon Jongwoo had amazing facial expressions, definitely the standout of the team in the facial expressions department. Again though, theres very few vocal/rap lines since they cut Verse 2 of Back Door and a lot of members dont get actual vocal/rap lines, so it makes the members tough to assess.

 The wildness of Krystian you look too feminine.... first for me, I didnt agree with that judges assessment based on what we saw, Krystian was trying to be fierce in the little snippets we saw of him as Center. Also, theres some idea inside that comment that has merit, but the way it was worded was yikes, just say You need fiercer and more powerful facial expressions, hell, even saying You need to give off more manly energy would be a better worded statement.

 The Krystian evil edit in full swing.... well, a lot of Redditors did correctly predict this would happen pre season, so props to them its a little sad how predictable Mnet can be.

 Back Door G Group: Chen Jianyu had a pretty solid rap, Feng Junlan did a decent job with the vocals as well. Again, I dont really have much to say since theres barely any actual vocal/rap lines in the song for the members to deliver. Facial expressions wise based on the focus cams, no one really stood out from this team in my personal opinion Chen Jianyu did the best of them imo.

 Hot Sauce G Group: Since the audience comments panned this performance, Id bet a good amount of money that Mnet autotuned the vocals and stuff to make the performance look better than it was because in prior seasons, they usually do that for performances that were panned by the audience. Oh well, what we saw and heard was pretty decent anyways I feel like it maybe was fine tuned here on the episode compared to the focus cams, but dont quote me on that lol. Ill rewatch the focus cams again to see if there was any tuning on the episode.

 Itll be interesting to see whether a strict leader in a positive edit Park Hanbin or a strict leader in a dramatic edit ex. Na Kamden, Park Minseok, Chen Yugeng gets a bigger increase in popularity. I suppose the question is partially nullified because Minseok and Yugeng are likely being eliminated in the first eliminations, so itll be Phanbin vs Kamden, and then the circumstances of Kamdens narrative ex. being the only non Chinese member leading an all Chinese team will make the comparison too dissimilar to have any real takeaways.

 Hot Sauce K Group: Pretty solid performance overall. The 3 Parks Park Jihoo, Park Hhyunbeen, and Park Hanbin all did really well. Genuinely curious why Park Hanbin did not take the Main Vocalist role hes a better vocalist than Lee Donggun or seemingly try for Center, but given how much he was hyped even before the performance began, I guess it was a win for him because he gets all the Center boost effect without being Center and can go for Center for the rest of the rounds without problem.

 Ollie still got 60 votes even though the audience comments were the most negative on him? Likewise I find it funny that the comments in this section are saying Ollies votes were so low, 60 votes is way more than most contestants get during this mission, especially compared to the rest of G Group and compared to his popularity. Maybe this really was a case of The select few of the audience we heard from gave unrepresentative opinions.

 This is the second episode in a row theyve pointed out Sung Hanbin not going for Center lol, really pushing out all the efforts here with the golden edit.

 Love Me Right K Group: They surprisingly didnt highlight Sung Hanbin as much during the performance as I thought they would, I guess Mnet know already that most of the eyes are already on him. Its kinda funny to see Mnet resume the Hui vs Jay narrative after a large break in the episode from it I just find it funny how all the discussion has been reduced down to comparing these two specifically instead of against the whole field of performances. Hui and Han Seobin were the MVPs for me, Lee Yedam was very good as well.
was there no rankings at the end?
Mnet smiting Krystian with vengeance for having the gall to have a preshow fan base and rank in the 20s is wild. I was not expecting an evil edit on nearly Cai Bing level this early in the show, this shouldnt be scary for just Krystian fans, but a lot of contestants. If theyre already going this hard, just imagine how brutal theyre going to be later in the season when the stakes get higher.
